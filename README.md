## Renewable Energy Dashboard

**Renewable Energy Dashboard** is an Excel-based analytical tool developed to visualize, compare, and analyze global renewable energy data. Designed for researchers, policymakers, and energy analysts, this dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the trends and developments across renewable energy sectors worldwide.

### Overview

The dashboard integrates multiple datasets covering electricity generation and capacity, investment flows, employment statistics, and energy consumption across countries and regions over several decades. It supports detailed exploration through interactive elements and macros, enabling dynamic analysis within Microsoft Excel.

### Key Features

* **Interactive Dashboard**: Consolidated, high-level visual summaries of renewable energy trends.
* **Country and Regional Drilldowns**: In-depth views segmented by country, region, and energy technology.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Renewable vs. non-renewable energy performance across multiple dimensions.
* **Investment Tracking**: Capital flows into renewable energy projects, categorized by year and geography.
* **Employment Insights**: Sector-specific job data (e.g., solar, wind, bioenergy).
* **Historical Consumption**: Longitudinal analysis of energy consumption by type.
* **Macro Integration**: Enables interactive charts, filters, and dynamic views through embedded VBA macros.
